This document describes a protocol for exchanging formal documents (such as invoices)
between businesses. TAP is a secure, decentralised, peer to peer architecture where gateways
are optional and minimally trusted.

This specification aims to support the Australian Digital Business Council
[eInvoicing initiative](https://ausdigital.github.io), and is under active development
at [https://github.com/ausdigital/access-point](https://github.com/ausdigital/access-point).
